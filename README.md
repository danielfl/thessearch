thessearch
==========

Based on my final exam in the "Faculdade de Americana" - Americana - SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil

My own search engine, made in python, it uses thesaurus, wordnet and one data source to learn and categorize the target.

Modules
 - spider robot - generates a cache from websites link by link 
 - network robot -  enter in each machine in a network to find files in a related category
 - learn module - you can use a data source as an input (for example a book about network) so the search engine will learn how it looks like

Language: python, xml
