thessearch
==========

Based on my final exam in the "Faculdade de Americana" - Americana - SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil

My own search engine, made in python, it uses thesaurus, wordnet and one data source to learn and categorize the target.

Modules
 - spider robot	 - generate a cache from websites link by link as common web spiders do
 - network robot - enter in each machine in a network to find files in a related category
 - learn module	 - you can use a data source as an input (for example a book about network) so the search engine will learn how it looks like


Language: Python, XML
